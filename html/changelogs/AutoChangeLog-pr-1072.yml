changes:
  - tweak: Beam tasers were replaced with the ones firing electrode projectiles. Those
      don't pass through windows/airlocks.
  - tweak: P90 rubber bullets deal less pain. This should make them less deadly and
      allow for their use for non-lethal takedowns.
  - tweak: P90 firing sound replaced.
  - tweak: Guard lockers had their contents updated and standardized.
  - tweak: Sprites for non-guard armor vests/carriers(i.e. riot suit) were updated.
